Onix - Web services / API test system
=======================================

After looking at a number of API and web services testing packages I found that, although they were all good, none of them did exactly what I wanted.  So I created Onix.  This package allows you to create custom tests for each of the API calls and should allow good granularity of control over what constitutes a pass or a fail.

The system is still in development, so I'm not going to add much documentation for now, but hopefully I'll come back later and finish this off.
